# Matrix Number Counter

## Description
This program initializes a 3x3 matrix with preset values. It then prompts the user to input a number, and it counts how many times that number appears in the matrix.

## Features
- Predefined 3x3 matrix.
- Prompts the user to enter a number.
- Counts and displays how many times the number occurs in the matrix.
- Prints the matrix in a formatted way.

## Functions
- `RandomNumber(int From, int To)`: Generates a random number (not used in this code).
- `ReadNumber(string message)`: Displays a message and reads an integer input from the user.
- `FillaMatrix3x3(...)`: Placeholder function that does nothing in this context.
- `CounterNumberInMatrix(...)`: Counts the occurrences of a specific number in the matrix.
- `PrintMatrix(...)`: Prints the matrix with 2-digit formatting.

## Example
If the matrix is:
```

05  02  05
03  05  04
01  01  05

```
And the user enters `5`, the output will be:
```

Number 5 count in matrix is  4

```
```
